 # üè† HUJURAT HOMES - Luxury Real Estate Web Application
This project is a high-fidelity, fully responsive front-end template for a luxury real estate brokerage, Hujurat Homes. It features a modern, clean design with a focus on an intuitive property search experience, using a dark aesthetic combined with clean white and professional green accents.

 # üöÄ Key Features
Responsive Navigation (Navbar): A sticky header with desktop and mobile menu support. The actual Hujurat Homes logo is integrated.

Hero Section: A luxurious, full-screen viewport with a background image overlay and a prominent headline.

Floating Search Bar (SearchBar): A central component allowing users to filter properties by Location, Type, and Price Range. The search bar is visually decoupled from the hero banner to draw attention.

Featured Listings: A placeholder section demonstrating how property cards will be displayed in a responsive grid layout.

Modern Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for fast, utility-first styling and Inter/Playfair Display fonts for a professional and luxurious feel.

üñºÔ∏è Logo Implementation Note
The Logo component in src/App.jsx currently uses a placeholder URL:

<img 
  src="[https://placehold.co/150x40/000000/FACC15?text=HUJURAT+HOMES+LOGO](https://placehold.co/150x40/000000/FACC15?text=HUJURAT+HOMES+LOGO)" 
  alt="Hujurat Homes LTD Logo" 
  className="h-8 md:h-10 object-contain"
/>

ACTION REQUIRED: For deployment, replace the src attribute with the actual hosted URL of the Hujurat Homes logo image.
